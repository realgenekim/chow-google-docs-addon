const CREATE_PART1_SUMMARY =
`Summarize the essential framework from Part 1 of "The Vibe Coding Handbook" that will inform Part 2. Include:

1. The outline/structure of Part 1:
   - Preface: Steve and Gene's personal aha moments
   - Chapter 3: The Major Shift in Programming Happening Now
   - Chapter 4: Seven Decades of Technology Revolutions
   - Chapter 5: AI Changing All Knowledge Work
   - Chapter 6: Who This Book Is For
   - Chapter 7: What Becomes More Important in a World of Coding AI
   - Chapter 8: Pairing vs. Delegation with AI
   - Chapter 9: The Value That Vibe Coding Creates (FAAFO)

2. The key terminology distinguishing "vibe coding" from "vibe engineering" and the central kitchen/chef metaphor

3. The FAAFO framework (fast, ambitious, alone, fun, optionality)

4. Our position on the spectrum between AI skeptics and enthusiasts

5. The three critical elements that become more important with AI: architecture, feedback loops, and human judgment

6. The distinction between pairing and delegation with AI

Condense these concepts into a concise reference that maintains both the structural outline and philosophical foundation while preparing for the practical "how-to" focus of Part 2.`
