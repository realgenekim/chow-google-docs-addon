I'm working on "The Vibe Coding Handbook" - a book about using AI for software development that I've divided into multiple parts. I need help creating a prompt that will guide AI assistants in maintaining consistency when helping me write Part 2.

The prompt should:

1. Summarize the essential conceptual framework from Part 1 (outline, key terminology, frameworks, and positions)
2. Include representative excerpts that demonstrate our writing style and tone
3. Provide explicit guidance on voice, perspective, and stylistic elements to maintain

For the framework summary, include:
- The Part 1 outline/chapter structure
- The distinction between "vibe coding" and "vibe engineering"
- The FAAFO framework (fast, ambitious, alone, fun, optionality)
- Our middle-path position between AI skeptics and enthusiasts
- The three critical elements (architecture, feedback loops, judgment)
- The spectrum of AI collaboration (pairing vs. delegation)

For the style guidance:
- Select 2-3 exemplary passages that showcase our voice and approach
- Extract key stylistic elements to maintain (use of metaphor, first-person plural, direct reader address)
- Provide explicit instructions on maintaining this style

Format the prompt as a structured guide that an AI assistant could follow when helping write Part 2, which will focus on practical "how-to" guidance rather than conceptual foundations.

const CREATE_PART2_SUMMARY =

Create a comprehensive summary of Part 2 of "The Vibe Coding Handbook" that captures its essential framework, key concepts, and practical guidance. Include:

1. The overall structure and progression of Part 2:
   - How it transitions from the "why" of Part 1 to the "how" of practical implementation
   - The progression from mindset to tools to techniques
   - The evolution from chatbots to coding assistants to agents

2. The core terminology and conceptual distinctions in Part 2:
   - The definition of vibe coding vs. vibe engineering in practice
   - The distinction between chatbots, coding assistants, and agents
   - The evolution of coding from manual to chat to agentic

3. The key practical frameworks introduced:
   - The Chat Mindset (treating AI as a teammate, not a tool)
   - Task Graphs (breaking complex problems into manageable chunks)
   - Prompt and context management techniques
   - Validation and verification approaches
   - Agent management strategies

4. The practical guidance for implementation:
   - When to use chatbots vs. coding assistants
   - Techniques for effective context management
   - How to validate AI-generated code
   - Approaches to automation with agents

5. The war stories and real-world examples that illustrate:
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Successful applications of the techniques
   - Lessons learned from failures

Present this summary in a way that maintains the conversational, accessible style of the original while distilling the most actionable information someone would need to effectively implement vibe coding in their work.
