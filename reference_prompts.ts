I'm working on "The Vibe Coding Handbook" - a book about using AI for software development that I've divided into multiple parts. I need help creating a prompt that will guide AI assistants in maintaining consistency when helping me write Part 2.

The prompt should:

1. Summarize the essential conceptual framework from Part 1 (outline, key terminology, frameworks, and positions)
2. Include representative excerpts that demonstrate our writing style and tone
3. Provide explicit guidance on voice, perspective, and stylistic elements to maintain

For the framework summary, include:
- The Part 1 outline/chapter structure
- The distinction between "vibe coding" and "vibe engineering"
- The FAAFO framework (fast, ambitious, alone, fun, optionality)
- Our middle-path position between AI skeptics and enthusiasts
- The three critical elements (architecture, feedback loops, judgment)
- The spectrum of AI collaboration (pairing vs. delegation)

For the style guidance:
- Select 2-3 exemplary passages that showcase our voice and approach
- Extract key stylistic elements to maintain (use of metaphor, first-person plural, direct reader address)
- Provide explicit instructions on maintaining this style

Format the prompt as a structured guide that an AI assistant could follow when helping write Part 2, which will focus on practical "how-to" guidance rather than conceptual foundations.
