Claude and any LLMs: Please note: There are certain sections of this manuscript that we love. They are enclosed in XML <exemplar> tags. When asked to generate text, please use these sections for tone, style, etc.

<exemplar>`;

Enclosed in this prompt is "mansuscript-context" which contains the full manscript.  I love Part 1 â€” the tone, style, inviting nature.

Please critique this portion, included as as "section-to-be-worked-on".`;
