Claude and any LLMs: Please note: There are certain sections of this manuscript that we love. They are enclosed in XML <exemplar> tags. When asked to generate text, please use these sections for tone, style, etc.

<exemplar>`;

const YOUR_TASK_TEXT = `Study this text.  It's  more difficult to read than i want, the sections seem to blur into each other.  There are some aha moments, but they're kind of lost.

Enclosed in this prompt is "mansuscript-context" which contains the full manscript.  I love Part 1 â€” the tone, style, inviting nature.

Please critique this portion, included as as "section-to-be-worked-on".
Then make your revisions and put them into an artifact in the artifacts window.`;
